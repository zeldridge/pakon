Pakon FX35 x64 Drivers - Public Release 1 (3.0.0.0)

System Requirements:
- Windows 10, version 2004 or later, for x64-based PCs. (AKA, an Intel or AMD processor.)
  Not sure what version you have? Press Windows+R, type "winver" (without the quotes), enter, and look for the "Version" text. If the version number starts with 2, you're good to go.
- At least 2GB of RAM. The more the better.
- A decent amount of storage.
- .NET 6.0 installed; you can get it here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.8-windows-x64-installer

Client Software Installation:
1. Download and install the Pakon client software: https://www.dropbox.com/s/o7hyo3uh3y6av4r/PakonUpdate.zip
   NOTE: Run [Pakon Update\fx35install\setup.exe] first, followed by [Pakon Update\setup.exe].
   NOTE 2: When the installer asks if you want to install .NET Framework 1.1, DECLINE. The .NET 1.1 installer does not work properly.
2. You're done with this part! (Unless you have an F235 or F335, in which case you need to set up an extra disk partition... but you probably already knew that.)

Driver Installation:
0. Reminder: Make sure to install .NET 6.0 if you haven't done so already! 
			 Download: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.8-windows-x64-installer
1. Open the "installer" folder and launch SkmPakonInstaller.exe.
2. Read the terms of use ("I understand that...") If you agree with them, check the box next to them. Otherwise, DO NOT CONTINUE.
3. Click the "INSTALL" button, wait for a "Done!" popup, and you're all set! (If the scanner is plugged in and turned on, turn it off and then on again.)

Scanning:
1. Launch TLXClientDemo. (PSI "works" but is basically unusable due to issues with the database system.)
2. Use TLXClientDemo. It doesn't get much easier than this.

Reporting Issues:
If you encounter any major issues (for example, a system crash attributed to FX35Loader.sys or F[1,2,3]35USB3.sys), please contact me directly on Facebook. I may be slow to respond, but I will try to assist.
